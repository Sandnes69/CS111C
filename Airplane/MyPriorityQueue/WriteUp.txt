I enjoyed reading about queues as opposed to the other abstract data structures... probably because it got straight to the point and gave a real life example (time-driven simulation). I feel more comfortable with Linked Lists now that I watched some visualization of how it works. Not sure if PriorityQueue implemeted QueueInterface, but I made MyPriorityQueue implement it, so the methods are the same, except with different names.
